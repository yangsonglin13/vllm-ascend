# Tensor R-Fork (RFork) Guide

This guide explains how to use **Tensor R-Fork** as a model-loader plugin in **vLLM Ascend**.

---

## TL;DR

**Tensor R-Fork** stands for **Tensor Remote Fork** and is abbreviated as **RFork**. It is a warm-start weight loading path for vLLM Ascend. Instead of always reading model weights from storage, a new instance can request a compatible **seed** instance from an external planner, then pull weights directly from that seed through `YuanRong TransferEngine`.

The "fork" is a remote tensor-level operation, not an operating-system process fork. RFork treats the NPU memory of an existing vLLM instance as a reusable weight source; the destination creates an independent model instance and reads the seed's registered tensors into its pre-allocated NPU parameter buffers.

## Background

For large models, repeatedly loading the same checkpoint can make storage and host-side staging the main startup bottlenecks. RFork changes the warm-start data path for later replicas:

| Load weights from | Data flow | Typical bottleneck |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Remote storage | Remote storage → remote network → local network interface → local host DRAM → local NPU memory | Storage or network bandwidth |
| Local disk | Local disk → host DRAM → NPU memory | Disk bandwidth |
| Local host DRAM | Host DRAM → NPU memory | Host-to-device interconnect |
| RFork seed instance | Seed NPU memory → YuanRong TransferEngine → destination NPU memory | Inter-node transport bandwidth |

This design provides the following benefits for scale-out deployments:

- **Faster warm starts** by reusing tensors that are already resident on another NPU instance.
- **Less repeated storage traffic** because later replicas do not need to read the complete checkpoint again when a compatible seed is available.
- **Less host-side staging** because TransferEngine reads registered tensor ranges into the destination's final NPU buffers.
- **Lower source-side disruption** because the seed exposes registered memory instead of reloading or broadcasting the model through vLLM workers. Actual inference impact still depends on the inter-node transport, available bandwidth, and concurrent transfer load.

The first instance still needs to load the model normally. RFork accelerates subsequent compatible instances; it is not a replacement for the initial checkpoint load.

At cluster scale, this turns running vLLM Ascend replicas into a distributed pool of NPU-resident weight sources. An instance provides inference compute while also making its already-materialized tensors available to later replicas.

### Default Loader vs. RFork

| Characteristic | Default loader | RFork |
|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Weight source | Model storage | Running seed instance |
| Destination path | Storage and host staging before reaching NPU memory | TransferEngine reads into pre-allocated NPU buffers |
| Additional dependency | None beyond the normal model-loading stack | YuanRong TransferEngine and an RFork planner |
| Setup overhead | Storage access and checkpoint deserialization | NPU memory registration and seed discovery |
| Repeated scale-out | Every instance reads the checkpoint | Compatible instances reuse an existing seed |
| Failure behavior | Loading fails if the checkpoint path is unavailable | RFork falls back after successful cleanup; unresolved memory or seed-service cleanup aborts loading |

RFork is most useful when the same model and parallel configuration are started repeatedly. For a single cold start, memory registration and planner coordination add work without an existing seed to reuse.

## Architecture

RFork consists of four cooperating components:

- **Planner**: Tracks seed identity, deployment topology, health, and transfer leases, then selects a compatible seed for each destination.
- **Seed instance**: An initialized vLLM Ascend instance that registers its live NPU weight buffers and publishes TransferEngine metadata.
- **Destination instance**: A new vLLM Ascend instance that creates the matching tensor layout and pulls weights into its local NPU buffers.
- **YuanRong TransferEngine**: Manages registered memory and performs batched reads between the seed and destination.

    S -.->|"Advertise / heartbeat"| P
    P <-.->|"Seed / lease"| D
    D <-->|"Seed HTTP metadata"| S
    S ==>|"TransferEngine weights"| D
```

Dashed arrows show **Planner coordination**, thin arrows show **Seed HTTP metadata exchange**, and the thick arrow shows **TransferEngine weight data**. The destination requests the seed's transfer session, tensor addresses, and shapes over HTTP, then initiates batch reads from Seed NPU memory into its local NPU buffers. The Planner and Seed HTTP service do not carry tensor contents.

The diagram shows one matching rank pair. Each destination worker independently acquires a seed for its TP/PP/EP shard identity and transfers that shard into its own NPU buffers. Different destination ranks may select corresponding seed workers from different instances. After loading and releasing its source lease, a destination can advertise itself as another seed.

### End-to-End Workflow

The RFork loading flow is:

1. vLLM starts with `--load-format rfork`.
2. RFork builds a **seed key** from the model identity and deployment topology.
3. RFork initializes the local model and prepares/synchronizes any required processed tensor layout, then asks the planner for a seed matching that key.
4. If a seed is returned, the new instance registers local weight memory, fetches the remote transfer-engine metadata from the seed, and performs batch weight transfer into local parameter buffers.
5. If no seed is available, or any transfer step fails, RFork cleans up and falls back to the default loader.
6. After a successful transfer, RFork schedules asynchronous source-lease release, completes any remaining post-load processing, and switches the model to evaluation mode. It then starts a local seed service and advertises it to the planner when the source lease has been released. A seed-service startup failure retains the loaded model and cleans up Seed resources as far as safely possible.

```

Model initialization and required layout preparation happen **before lease acquisition**, keeping the lease focused on registration, metadata exchange, and transfer. Session setup, initialization, layout, or post-load errors also use the fallback cleanup path. If the default loader itself fails, model loading fails.

Source-lease release runs asynchronously with bounded retries. A pending release delays Seed publication without discarding the loaded model; publication can resume after release is acknowledged. Exhausted release retries or incomplete cleanup suppress publication. A Seed service startup or advertisement failure also **keeps the loaded model**, with no checkpoint reload. When dynamic EPLB disables RFork, the loader bypasses this flow and uses the default loader directly.

TransferEngine metadata is exchanged through the seed HTTP service, while tensor contents are transferred through TransferEngine. Each worker owns its own TransferEngine session and listening port, so corresponding parallel ranks transfer their local weight shards independently.

### Seed-Side Initialization

After a vLLM Ascend instance finishes loading its model, each RFork worker prepares the tensors that another instance may read:

1. RFork prepares the transferable Ascend tensor layout and enumerates the live model tensors.
2. Logical tensor ranges are associated with their backing NPU allocations. Overlapping logical ranges that share one allocation are registered without registering the same backing memory repeatedly.
3. Registration requests are split into bounded batches before being submitted to YuanRong TransferEngine.
4. The worker publishes its TransferEngine session, tensor addresses, element sizes, and shapes through the local seed service.
5. A heartbeat advertises the seed key, address, port, and rank to the planner.

The seed remains a normal serving instance. RFork does not ask it to reread the checkpoint or run a model-weight broadcast. Transfers can still consume inter-node and NPU-memory bandwidth, so production deployments should control concurrent readers and observe inference latency.

### Destination-Side Loading

The destination performs the following steps for each worker rank:

1. Build the destination model structure and allocate the final NPU tensor layout.
2. After required layout preparation and synchronization, acquire a seed lease and register the destination tensor ranges with its local TransferEngine session.
3. Fetch the matching seed worker's session and tensor manifest over HTTP.
4. Verify tensor names, element counts, element sizes, and shapes before transferring data.
5. Group tensors into bounded chunks and use batched synchronous reads to copy them into the destination buffers.
6. Schedule bounded asynchronous lease release after the transfer, whether it succeeds or falls back.

Once loading completes, the destination can publish itself as another seed. A deployment can therefore grow from one storage-loaded instance into a pool of reusable NPU-resident weight sources.

### Registration and Shutdown Lifecycle

Each worker uses an `RForkSession` to own the planner lease, registered tensors, seed HTTP service, and heartbeat. The session coordinates fallback cleanup and finalizes TransferEngine only after the seed service stops and the outgoing lease is released. Configuration, manifest validation, and HTTP clients are separate RFork modules; startup arguments and environment variable names remain unchanged.

Registered NPU memory must remain valid while remote readers may still hold leases. RFork therefore keeps Python tensor owners and TransferEngine registration state alive until unregistration or finalization succeeds.

If transfer fails, fallback makes up to two cleanup attempts. If the seed service
or registered memory still cannot be cleaned up, loading fails explicitly while
memory owners remain retained. RFork does not allocate a second model on top of
the pinned weights. A pending source lease alone does not block fallback.

Only a complete model may become a seed. After post-load processing and eval,
RFork re-registers on the loading thread only when checkpoint-layout processing
may have replaced storage; processed-layout transfers reuse the final buffers
directly before publishing or deferring publication. A failed transfer or
incomplete cleanup cannot be treated as a successful seed startup. Workers with
no independent transferable weights do not advertise an empty manifest.

A fully shared draft is identified before any draft post-load processing when
all of its tensor ranges are already shared with the loaded target. Because the
target already has processed buffers, RFork skips all draft post-load
processing and reuses those weights locally, without acquiring a seed lease or
publishing an empty seed. Partial overlap is not treated as complete sharing.

During worker shutdown, RFork first stops advertising the seed, terminates the heartbeat, and closes the local seed service. It then finalizes TransferEngine. If remote reads are still active, finalization retries `ErrorCode.kNotReady` with a bounded delay. If the seed service cannot stop or finalization does not complete within the retry limit, RFork retains the registration state rather than releasing memory that may still be referenced.

During shutdown, RFork cancels new source-lease release retries and does not
wait for an already-running release HTTP request. If that release is still
unacknowledged, RFork retains the associated resources. A lease with no
in-flight release is not retried automatically after shutdown; its cleanup
depends on the planner's agreed expiry or reclamation behavior. Requests
connect/read timeouts limit inactivity for each request, not a bounded total
request duration.

## Application Scenarios

- **Scale-out after a first successful load**: The first instance may still load from storage, but later instances with the same deployment identity can reuse it as a seed and shorten startup time.
- **Elastic serving clusters**: Because RFork asks a planner for available seeds, it fits clusters where instances are created and reclaimed dynamically.
- **Topology-sensitive deployments**: RFork encodes optional `pp_rank`, `tp_rank`, and optional `ep_rank` into the seed key, so only shard-compatible instances are matched together. The `kv_role` and the physical node are deliberately excluded, so prefill and decode instances on different nodes can share seeds.

## Usage

To enable RFork, pass `--load-format rfork` and provide RFork settings through `--model-loader-extra-config` as a JSON string.

### RFork Prerequisites

- Install `YuanRong TransferEngine` on every RFork instance.
- Run a planner service that implements the RFork seed protocol. A simple mock planner script is provided at [`rfork_planner.py`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/blob/main/examples/rfork/rfork_planner.py).

### Configuration Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description | Allowed Values / Notes |
|------------|------|-------------|------------------------|
| **model_url** | String | Logical model identifier used to build the RFork seed key. | Required for RFork transfer. Instances that should share seeds must use the same value. |
| **model_deploy_strategy_name** | String | Deployment strategy identifier used together with `model_url` to build the seed key. | Required for RFork transfer. Instances that should share seeds must use the same value. |
| **rfork_scheduler_url** | String | Base URL of the planner service used for seed allocation, release, and heartbeat. | Required for planner-based matching. Example: `http://127.0.0.1:1223`. |
| **rfork_seed_timeout_sec** | Number | Timeout for waiting until the local seed HTTP service becomes healthy after startup. | Optional. Default: `5.0`. Must be finite and greater than `0`. Invalid values fall back to a valid environment value, then the default. |
| **rfork_request_timeout_sec** | Number | Connection/read timeout for each planner and seed HTTP request, not an end-to-end deadline. | Optional. Default: `10.0`. Must be finite and greater than `0`; invalid values fall back to a valid environment value, then the default. |
| **rfork_heartbeat_interval_sec** | Number | Delay before the next seed heartbeat after the previous heartbeat request completes. | Optional. Default: `30.0`. Must be a finite, positive JSON number. JSON-only `model-loader-extra-config` field; invalid explicit values raise `ValueError`; no environment fallback. |
| **rfork_lease_release_max_attempts** | Integer | Maximum number of attempts for lease release, including the initial request. | Optional. Default: `3`. Must be a positive JSON integer. JSON-only `model-loader-extra-config` field; invalid explicit values raise `ValueError`; no environment fallback. Rejected responses stop immediately. |
| **rfork_lease_release_retry_interval_sec** | Number | Wait between transient lease-release failures. | Optional. Default: `30.0`. Must be a finite, positive JSON number. JSON-only `model-loader-extra-config` field; invalid explicit values raise `ValueError`; no environment fallback. |
| **rfork_seed_bind_host** | String | Local address/interface for the seed HTTP server. | Optional. Default: `0.0.0.0`. |
| **rfork_seed_advertise_host** | String | Address reported to the planner for later receivers. | Optional. Default: auto-detect the local address. |

RFork manages its environment fallbacks in its own `RForkConfig` configuration module:

The request timeout also accepts `request_timeout_sec`. Bind host accepts
`seed_bind_host` and `bind_host`; advertise host accepts `seed_advertise_host`
and `advertise_host`. When several aliases are provided, the first present key
wins in the order shown here, with the `rfork_` field taking precedence.

| Environment variable | Default | Notes |
|----------------------|---------|-------|
| `MODEL_URL` | unset | |
| `MODEL_DEPLOY_STRATEGY_NAME` | unset | |
| `RFORK_SCHEDULER_URL` | unset | |
| `RFORK_SEED_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `5.0` | Finite and positive only. |
| `RFORK_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `10.0` | Finite and positive only. |
| `RFORK_SEED_BIND_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | |
| `RFORK_SEED_ADVERTISE_HOST` | auto-detect | |

`model_loader_extra_config` takes precedence over environment values for fields
that support environment fallbacks. Numeric values reject booleans, NaN,
infinity, and non-positive values. The three operational fields above are
JSON-only; invalid explicit values raise `ValueError` rather than using an
environment fallback.

Heartbeat scheduling waits `rfork_heartbeat_interval_sec` after each heartbeat
request completes (default: `30.0`); it is not a fixed-rate interval. Seed
heartbeats report health and do not renew leases. The lease-release fields
affect lease release only; the public synchronous release helper uses the same
configured max-attempt and retry-interval values. Client-side seed deregistration
(`remove_seed`) keeps its internal retry policy of three attempts with
`0.1`-second linear backoff.

### How RFork Matches Seeds

RFork does not match instances by `model_url` alone. The seed identity is composed from:

- `model_url`
- `model_deploy_strategy_name`
- `pp_rank` when pipeline parallel size is greater than 1
- `tp_rank`
- `ep_rank` when expert parallelism is enabled for an MoE model
- `draft` role when the worker runs as a draft model

The parallel ranks keep seed and receiver on the same model shard, while the
disaggregation role (`kv_role`) and the physical node are deliberately excluded
so prefill and decode instances on different nodes can share seeds.

The identity is anchored by a SHA256 compatibility fingerprint covering model
revision, dtype, quantization method, a digest of the full quantization config,
model architecture, tensor/pipeline/expert parallel world sizes, Ascend NZ
layout mode, and hardware layout policy. This prevents an old or differently
configured seed from being selected merely because its textual key happens to
match.

Two instances must agree on model identity and parallel layout before the planner will treat them as interchangeable seeds. The seed key is an opaque SHA256 digest, so seed and receiver instances must run the same RFork protocol to derive the same key.

### Planner Responsibilities

Lease release runs asynchronously after transfer. Planner release requests never hold the session lock. The client makes at most `rfork_lease_release_max_attempts` release attempts per lease (default: `3`, including the initial request), waiting `rfork_lease_release_retry_interval_sec` seconds (default: `30.0`) between transient failures (network errors, HTTP 408/429, or 5xx). These settings affect lease release only. Other rejected responses stop immediately even when attempts remain; HTTP 200 and 404 retain their existing acknowledgement semantics. The public synchronous release helper uses the same configured max-attempt and retry-interval values. Failed releases do not reload valid weights or prevent model loading from continuing, but the worker is not advertised as a new seed until release is acknowledged. After retry exhaustion, the unresolved lease remains recorded and requires planner-side investigation/recovery. Shutdown does not wait for release I/O and retains TransferEngine resources if release is unresolved.

Release logs include a hashed lease identifier, attempt count, elapsed acquisition-to-release time, HTTP status and a bounded response excerpt with control characters removed and the lease ID redacted. These allow diagnosis without printing the raw USER_ID credential. Per-request timeouts are connect/read inactivity limits, not a strict total wall-clock deadline.

The example planner reclaims abandoned leases after 60 seconds by default, independently of seed heartbeat expiry. Configure a positive integer duration with `--lease-ttl-sec` or `RFORK_MOCK_LEASE_TTL_SEC`; an explicit CLI value takes precedence over a valid environment value. The loader acquires its lease after model initialization and any required layout preparation/synchronization. Size the timeout for memory registration, metadata fetch, transfer and asynchronous release, including retry delays. Initialization and layout timings are logged separately. Seed heartbeats do not renew leases. Expired leases return 404 on release, which the current client accepts as already released; successful startup alone does not prove that the lease remained valid throughout transfer.

If no seed is available after preparation, the loader discards the prepared model and loads from the checkpoint. This adds preparation cost to a seed miss. Before fallback, it restores the pre-attempt compilation registries and rotary cache so shared main/draft state is preserved. Model construction and rollback in a worker are assumed to be serialized. Lease renewal is not enabled: it requires explicit support from both planner and client.

For example, start the planner with a 60-second lease TTL:

```text
python examples/rfork/rfork_planner.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 1223 --lease-ttl-sec 60
```

Increasing the lease TTL does not change the seed heartbeat TTL (`--heartbeat-ttl-sec`, default 60 seconds). The planner process reads these settings at startup; changing a client-side environment variable does not reconfigure a running planner.

After an instance becomes ready, each worker periodically reports its seed metadata to the planner. A new instance asks the planner for a seed with the same seed key; the planner selects one with available capacity and returns a lease. A missing or unhealthy seed is not fatal because the destination can use the default loader and later join the seed pool itself.

The bundled planner demonstrates this workflow, but it is a functional example rather than a production scheduler. A production planner should provide:

- compatibility matching based on model identity and parallel deployment topology;
- heartbeat-based health tracking and stale-seed removal;
- capacity and lease accounting so one seed is not overloaded by concurrent destinations;
- reliable lease release when a transfer completes or fails;
- observability for seed selection, transfer failures, and fallback frequency.

### Quantized Models

For quantized models, RFork transfers tensors after Ascend weight post-processing instead of raw checkpoint parameters. The receiver first builds the same post-load tensor layout as the seed, then RFork copies the live NPU tensors used by inference.

This path handles Ascend quantization changes such as weight transposition, NZ format conversion, packed weights, derived scale tensors, and MLA/SFA runtime tensors such as `W_UV` and `W_UK_T`. Empty tensors that were released during post-processing are not included in the transfer manifest.

When validating RFork for a quantized model:

- Apply the same vLLM Ascend code to both the seed instance and the receiver instance.
- Restart the planner and all vLLM instances after changing RFork code, because existing seeds keep their old transfer metadata.
- Use a new `model_deploy_strategy_name` after changing model arguments or RFork code when operating with an older planner; compatibility fingerprints also reject incompatible old seeds before native transfer.
- A successful RFork transfer logs `transfer weights starts` and `transfer weights time`. The fallback path logs `RFork transfer failed`.

## Supported Models

Mainstream DeepSeek/Qwen/GLM series are supported.

## Performance Considerations

RFork indexes tensor intervals for allocator-block lookup and uses binary search to verify backing-memory coverage before registration. New seed services return weight and shape metadata together in one HTTP response; receivers retain the two-request path for older seed services that omit inline shape metadata.

RFork performance depends on model size, parallelism, NPU memory layout, TransferEngine registration time, inter-node bandwidth, and the number of concurrent destinations.

For an NPU deployment, compare RFork with the default loader using at least these metrics:

- time from process start until the service becomes ready;
- `transfer weights time` and transferred bytes reported in the vLLM logs;
- storage and host-memory traffic during startup;
- seed-instance inference latency while transfers are active;
- seed hit rate, transfer failure rate, and fallback rate.

Memory registration adds setup cost to the seed. Its benefit is realized when later replicas reuse that registration, so tests should include repeated scale-out rather than only a single cold start.

## Example Commands & Placeholders

> Replace parts in `<...>` before running.

### 1. Install YuanRong TransferEngine

```shell
pip install openyuanrong-datasystem
```

### 2. Start the Planner

A simple planner implementation is provided at [`rfork_planner.py`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/blob/main/examples/rfork/rfork_planner.py).

```shell
python rfork_planner.py \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port <planner_port>
```

### 3. Start vLLM Instances

Use the same RFork startup command for both the first instance and later instances in the same deployment.

For the first instance, the planner usually has no compatible seed yet, so RFork falls back to the default loader. After loading finishes, that instance starts its local seed service and reports itself to the planner.

For later instances, if the planner can allocate a compatible seed, RFork will try to transfer weights from the existing seed instance before falling back to the default loader.

```shell
export RFORK_CONFIG='{
  "model_url": "<model_url>",
  "model_deploy_strategy_name": "<deploy_strategy>",
  "rfork_scheduler_url": "http://<planner_ip>:<planner_port>",
  "rfork_request_timeout_sec": 10.0,
  "rfork_heartbeat_interval_sec": 30.0,
  "rfork_lease_release_max_attempts": 3,
  "rfork_lease_release_retry_interval_sec": 30.0,
  "rfork_seed_bind_host": "0.0.0.0",
  "rfork_seed_advertise_host": "<seed_ip>"
}'

vllm serve <model_path> \

## Note & Caveats

- RFork requires `MemoryRegistration`, `ErrorCode.kNotReady`, `batch_register_memory_ex()`, and `finalize()` from `YuanRong TransferEngine`. Packages without these APIs cannot initialize the transfer backend; RFork falls back to the default loader and does not start a seed service.
- If RFork is used, **each worker process** must bind a listening port. The seed bind host is configurable and the port is assigned randomly.
- RFork currently requires all materialized model parameters and registered buffers to reside on NPU. Mixed CPU/NPU or CPU-offloaded model state is rejected and falls back to the default loader rather than performing a partial transfer.
- Keep the seed bind/advertise addresses reachable from the receiver workers. Transport encryption and access control remain the deployment's responsibility, so use HTTPS and network isolation for untrusted networks.
- RFork weight transfer does not support dynamic EPLB because expert weights and placement can change after the seed service starts. If `parallel_config.enable_eplb`, `eplb_config.dynamic_eplb`, or `eplb_config.expert_map_record_path` enables EPLB, RFork transfer is bypassed and the model is loaded through the default model loader.
- The example [`rfork_planner.py`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/blob/main/examples/rfork/rfork_planner.py) is only a simple mock implementation. If you need stronger scheduling, capacity management, or production-grade availability behavior, implement your own planner based on the RFork seed protocol.
